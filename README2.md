# Introduction

_This is my project for the BWI Coding Challenge, it is an algorithm that generates a transport plan with the highest utility! **[The Challenge.](https://www.get-in-it.de/coding-challenge?utm_source=magazin&utm_campaign=coding-challenge&utm_content=code-and-win)**_

## Installation
You need to install NodeJS. Install git or just download the repository as a zip file:
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/Intevel/BWI-Coding-Challenge

cd BWI-Coding-Challenge

npm install
```

## What is this?
> So it's actually just an algorithm that loads products / devices and transporters information from a JSON file. Each of these devices has a number, weight, and utility value. Each transporter has a weight limit of 1100kg, not including the weight of the driver. Two transporters are specified, but this can be expanded by adding more transporters to the JSON file. This algorithm creates a transport plan for each transporter, which is tailored to the weight and has the highest utility value.

## How to use
If all steps of the installation have been carried out successfully, you can run the index.js file which is located in the src folder! The algorithm then starts and creates text files which can be found under src / documents!
